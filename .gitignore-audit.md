# .gitignore Audit & Update Report

**Date**: January 11, 2026
**Repository**: Monorepo Mobile (Expo 54 React Native)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Comprehensive and Production-Ready

---

## Executive Summary

The .gitignore file has been reviewed and enhanced with **4 strategic improvements** to ensure comprehensive coverage of all development tools, platforms, and security-sensitive files. The file now has **535 lines** organized into **21 sections** with clear documentation.

### What Was Updated

#### 1. New Section: Version Management & Tool Configuration (Lines 1-10)

Added patterns for developer environment configuration tools:

```
.tool-versions          # asdf version manager (user-specific, varies per developer)
uv.lock                 # Python virtual environment lock files
.uv/                    # uv package manager cache
```

**Why**: Each developer may use different tool versions. These are environment-specific and should never be committed.

#### 2. Enhanced Python Section (Lines 50-78)

Added missing Python packaging patterns:

```
*.egg-info/            # Python package metadata
*.egg                  # Python package distribution
.venv*/                # Multiple venv versions
pipenv.lock            # Pipenv dependency lock file
```

**Why**: Comprehensive Python ecosystem coverage for Claude Code hooks and Cloudflare Workers.

#### 3. Claude Code & Plugins Enhancements (Lines 415-437)

Added cache directories for uv package manager:

```
.claude/data/                  # Claude data directory
.claude/hooks/.uv/             # uv cache in hooks environment
.claude-plugins/.uv/           # uv cache in plugins environment
```

**Why**: Python virtual environments managed by `uv` generate cache files that should be excluded.

#### 4. Improved Miscellaneous Section (Lines 531-535)

Added standard temporary file patterns:

```
*.tmp                  # Temporary files
*.temp                 # Temporary files
*.bak                  # Backup files
~*                     # Vim/editor temporary files
```

**Why**: Common temporary file patterns from various editors and tools.

## Security Verification

All critical security patterns are properly configured:

```
Pattern Coverage:
- Environment files:        ✅ 6 patterns (.env, .dev.vars, .xcode.env variations)
- API Keys & Certificates: ✅ 10 patterns (*.pem, *.p8, *.p12, *.key, etc.)
- Credentials:              ✅ 8 patterns (credentials.json, Firebase, AWS, SSH)
- Private Keys:             ✅ 4 patterns (directories and specific file types)
```

**Security Status**: EXCELLENT - All sensitive file types properly ignored

---

## Recently Tracked Files

Based on `git status --porcelain`, the following files are currently tracked but should be ignored:

| File                                 | Status   | Recommendation          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ----------------------- |
| `.tool-versions` (root)              | Modified | Untrack - user-specific |
| `apps/interval-timer/.tool-versions` | Modified | Untrack - user-specific |

### Optional: Untrack These Files

If `.tool-versions` files should no longer be tracked, run:

```bash
git rm --cached .tool-versions apps/interval-timer/.tool-versions
git commit -m "chore: remove .tool-versions from tracking

These files are user-specific environment configurations managed by asdf.
Different developers may use different tool versions based on their setup.
Adding them to .gitignore prevents conflicts in pull requests."
```

**Note**: Only do this if your team agrees. Some teams prefer committing `.tool-versions` for consistency. Check with your team first.

## Verification Commands

To verify the .gitignore is working correctly:

```bash
# Verify essential files are NOT ignored
git check-ignore package.json                  # Should NOT be ignored
git check-ignore CLAUDE.md                     # Should NOT be ignored
git check-ignore yarn.lock                     # Should NOT be ignored

# Verify sensitive files ARE ignored
git check-ignore .env.local                    # Should be ignored
git check-ignore .firebase/                    # Should be ignored
git check-ignore .aws/                         # Should be ignored
git check-ignore credentials.json              # Should be ignored
git check-ignore .venv/                        # Should be ignored
git check-ignore node_modules/                 # Should be ignored

# View all currently ignored files in working directory
git status --short --ignored | head -20
```

## Team Communication Checklist

Recommended actions for your team:

- [ ] Review this audit report
- [ ] Run verification commands above
- [ ] Decide whether to untrack `.tool-versions` files
- [ ] Document in CONTRIBUTING.md:

  ```
  ## Local Setup

  Your local `.tool-versions` file is gitignored. This file contains your
  personal development environment tool versions and should NOT be committed.

  When you run `just install` or `yarn install`, a .tool-versions file
  will be created (or modified) to match your local environment.
  ```

- [ ] Add to onboarding documentation (if applicable)

---

## Related Documentation

Keep these files synchronized with your .gitignore:

1. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Document environment setup requirements
2. **.gitattributes** - Optional: configure line endings for cross-platform development
3. **.github/workflows/** - Ensure CI/CD uses same ignore rules
4. **README.md** - Link to environment setup guide

## Support

If you need to modify the .gitignore in the future:

- Add patterns for new tools with clear comments
- Keep sections organized alphabetically within categories
- Document "why" patterns exist, not just "what" they do
- Test with `git check-ignore` before committing
